# Alexandria
Alexandria is a planning project that is supposed to make event planing in groups of multiple people easier. 
You can upload your personal events to the Database join groups and have the group leader pick times for events within that group.
You can passwordprotect your groups and manage the groups members as a leader.
The leader cannot see your Events but only how many members of the group are free within specific timeperiods.
